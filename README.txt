I wanted to make something with the little I knew about web 
developement. These are some tools that I found helpful while teaching 
in class. 

The timer and stopwatch are self-evident (at least I hope they are), but 
the Order Sorting is not.

I mostly used it to choose the order in which students do something. 



I would love to get some feedback or (fingers crossed) a pull request. 
The coding and design are things I hope to organize and improve upon.

Thank you for reading!!!
